# Pairpix

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Classic memory game with cards from which one must form pairs. This version uses animal drawings as patterns.

Two game modes are available: a classic one that scrolls through the screens, and a timed challenge to win a maximum of points.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## How to play ?

### Classic game mode

Game mode with score calculation. The number of pairs on the screen may vary.

A found pair earns 2 points.
A mistake loses 1 point.
Showing and hiding a card counts as an error.

The end of one tableau moves on to the next, with no time countdown.

### Challenge mode

Game mode with score calculation. The number of pairs on the screen can vary.
The aim is to achieve the highest score within 1 minute.

A found pair earns 2 points for the number of seconds remaining.
An error results in a loss of 1 point for the number of seconds remaining.
Showing and then hiding a card counts as an error.

The end of a tableau moves on to the next tableau within the time limit.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Pairpix).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* no submodule

Some formatted text is displayed using the [Delphi HTML Components](https://delphihtmlcomponents.com/) library. A license for this library is required if you wish to recompile the project as is.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Pairpix/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
